## How do I use this? ##

Install DotNetNuke 7.0 or later then while in the DesktopModules directory of your site execute the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/sschlesier/sf-webapi-helloworld.git MyServices

Now you can load the solution into Visual Studio and compile or edit as you see fit.
